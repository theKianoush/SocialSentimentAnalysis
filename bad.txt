So, I’ve had this for several weeks now and the scale is already on the fritz. It’s not working at all and it’s basically brand new! Buy everything but the scale. I don’t know how to return it unless I send it all back.
Trimming these was more work than it was worth. I've had the custom orthotic inserts where you stand on the machine and get your number and those were significantly better (and obviously more expensive). I figured since these are made by the same people they should be equally simple and comfortable, but they were not.
